# Contour Detection of Objects within Image

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of detecting contours of objects within an image using image processing techniques. Contour detection is a crucial technique in computer vision for identifying object boundaries in an image. The notebook leverages Python libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy to detect and visualize contours efficiently.

## Aim

The notebook covers the following steps for contour detection:

- **Image Preprocessing:** Prepare the image by converting it to grayscale and applying edge detection algorithms.
- **Contour Detection:** Use OpenCV's contour detection function to identify object boundaries within the image.
- **Contour Visualization:** Highlight the detected contours by drawing them on the original image for easy visualization.

## Practical Implementation

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Image Loading:** Load the input image using OpenCV.
2. **Grayscale Conversion:** Convert the image to grayscale to simplify the contour detection process.
3. **Edge Detection:** Apply edge detection techniques (e.g., Canny edge detection) to identify object boundaries.
4. **Contour Detection:** Use OpenCV's `findContours` method to detect contours from the edge-detected image.
5. **Drawing Contours:** Draw the detected contours onto the original image using `drawContours`.
6. **Visualization:** Display the final image with the contours highlighted.

## Requirements

- **Python Version:** 3.x
- **Libraries:**
    - NumPy
    - OpenCV
    - Matplotlib

## Usage

To run this notebook:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```

3. **Open the notebook in Jupyter.**

4. **Run each cell** to perform contour detection and visualize the results.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we explored how to detect and visualize contours of objects within an image. The key steps included:

- Converting the image to grayscale.
- Applying edge detection to highlight object boundaries.
- Using OpenCV's contour detection to extract object contours.
- Visualizing the detected contours on the original image.

Contour detection has a wide range of applications, including object recognition, shape analysis, and image segmentation. This notebook serves as a practical introduction to contour-based image analysis.
