# Basic Operations on Image Data (Part-A)

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates basic operations on image data using Python libraries such as NumPy and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It aims to introduce fundamental techniques for reading, manipulating, and analyzing image data, which are essential in image processing and computer vision tasks.

## Aim

To perform and understand basic operations on image data, including reading, modifying, and saving images.

## Theory

The notebook covers the theoretical aspects of representing and manipulating image data using arrays. It includes discussions on why image preprocessing is important in various computer vision applications.

## Practical Implementation

The notebook provides hands-on examples to:

- Manipulate numerical data using Python and NumPy.
- Work with images using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), including reading, displaying, resizing, cropping, and color manipulation.

## Requirements

- **Python Version:** 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Python Imaging Library (PIL)
  - Matplotlib (for visualizing images)

## Usage
